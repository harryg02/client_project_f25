      <h2>What is a Portfolio?</h2>
      <p>
        A portfolio is a curated collection of 3-5 projects, often presented as a website. It showcases your skills,
        process(es), and problem-solving abilities. Your portfolio is an opportunity
        to highlight your growth, creativity, and unique approach to solving problems. A strong portfolio emphasizes
        your thinking process, storytelling, and the real-world impact of your work.
        Employers and clients use portfolios to assess your qualifications and determine if you’re a good fit for their
        team or project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>[NOTE]</b> Portfolios are <b>typically required</b> for User Experience (UX) Design applications.
      </p>

      <h2>General Portfolio Guidelines:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Use templates: </b>You can customize and personalize your portfolio to reflect your design style,
          personality, and or unique brand. You do not need to code your own portfolio.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>When in-progress: </b>Don’t label “in progress”, keep the section/page unpublished while editing, outline
          next steps/anticipated next steps, and make sure pages are complete enough so someone can understand before
          publishing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use clear and direct navigation: </b>Less text/ paragraphs and easy navigation on desktop, tablet, and
          mobile.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>No clip art or unrelated stock images: </b>Develop unique visuals from your work!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Animation/ Motion: </b>Should only be purposefully used and can be turned off for accessibility purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Proofread: </b>Individually and with a friend, classmate, or family member.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Verbiage: </b>When describing U-M programs or events (i.e. UMSI Design Jams), use common terms and methods
          in the field (i.e. design challenge or design sprint).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips for Student/Entry Level Portfolios</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start a personal project to demonstrate your skills. Some example questions for projects include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              What physical product would you be interested in redesigning? How would you redesign it? (i.e. how to
              design a coffee mug that is more comfortable for someone with smaller hands)
            </li>
            <li>
              Think about an app that you currently use. How would you improve the design? How would you improve the
              functionality? How would you improve a user pain point that you experience? What steps would you take?
            </li>
            <li>
              Other examples of personal projects can be found in the UX Portfolio Guide and Rubric under
              <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8Sc0ezVVCvP9SdUDwr0hwrNAd3us0JBbmUpoCYN-rs/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=kix.dz0n9bbwsuyj">
                Personal Projects.</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Include personal and course projects in your Portfolio, especially if you don’t have work or internship
          experience related to your field yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include current class projects even if they aren’t completed yet.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Emphasize what you’ve accomplished and learned so far.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <P>
        <b>Dealing with Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs): </b>Even if you are bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement, you
        will need to share some insights or examples of your work that demonstrate what you learned.
        In some cases, you may need to create new artifacts and/or modify artifacts so that you can demonstrate what you
        learned without violating your NDA.
        It is up to you to understand the details of what can or cannot be shared to the public.
      </P>

      <p>
        Below are some examples of how portfolio creators highlighted their work on a project while still adhering to
        the requirements of their NDA.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Example Portfolio Projects with NDAs: </b>
          <ul>
            <li>Vectorform: <a
                href="https://greenmeg.info/index.php/work/vectorform/">https://greenmeg.info/index.php/work/vectorform/</a>
              (UMSI MSI Alum)</li>
            <li>Meta Intern: <a
                href="https://www.joannehuangdesign.com/projects/meta-internship">https://www.joannehuangdesign.com/projects/meta-internship</a>
              (UMSI MSI Alum)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          While many of these examples focus on user experience (UX) projects, the tactics for addressing the
          requirements of an NDA apply across areas of focus.
        </li>
      </ul>
